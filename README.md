# Plant-Health-Disease-Prediction

In order to stop or control the spread of plant diseases and pests, the process of recognizing, diagnosing, and monitoring the health of plants is referred to as "plant health detection." Any negative changes in a plant's health can have a big influence on the environment, agriculture, and the economy. Plant health is essential to their development and output. Visual inspection has historically been used to detect plant health, although this method can be labor- and timeintensive and subject to human error. However, because to technological advancements, a variety of tools and methods are now available for more
precise and effective plant health diagnosis, including molecular diagnostics, imaging techniques, and remote sensing. Plant health detection is a field ofstudy under the image recognition field of computer vision. Recognizing  leaves is of utmost importance in biodiversity conservation. The major project, detection of diseases in laves, is also another important milestone in conserving not just biodiversity but also saving crops from disease spread. The algorithm PCA has aided the process of leaf detection, by the monitoring of some basic features of leaves and then comparing the values obtained with the available data set.
